# DSA Hacking Club - C library for Data Structures and Algorithms

[![Build Status](https://github.com/alifoo/dsa_hkc/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alifoo/dsa_hkc/actions)

This is a collective library built to easily implement data structures and
algorithms in C, made by two students of the Pontifical Catholic University of
Paran√° (PUCPR).

## Requirements

* A C Compiler (like GCC or Clang)
* CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
* `make`

---

## How to Build and Install

Clone the repository and use CMake to build the project.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/alifoo/dsa_hkc.git](https://github.com/alifoo/dsa_hkc.git)
cd dsa_hkc

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# 3. Configure and build the project
cmake ..
make

# 4. (Optional) Install the library system-wide
sudo make install
```
This will install `libdsa_hkc.a` into `/usr/local/lib` and `dsa_hkc.h` into `/usr/local/include`.

### ## How to Use (API Example)

Once the library is installed, you can include the header in your own C projects and link against it during compilation.

**`example.c`**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dsa_hkc.h>

int main() {
    int result = add(20, 22);
    int squared_result = square(result);

    printf("The result is: %d\n", result);
    printf("The squared result is: %d\n", squared_result);

    return 0;
}
```

**Compile your program:**
```bash
# The -ldsa_hkc flag tells the compiler to link our library
gcc example.c -ldsa_hkc -o my_app
```
